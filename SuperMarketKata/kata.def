Supermarket Pricing
Description
A supermarket has a lot of different ways in which products may be priced. Pricing each of these requires
certain rules. In this Kata the requirements start off simple and new requirements are added later
representing a realistic development lifecycle. To represent this, we recommend doing each step in order
without reading ahead.


Requirements

Step 1: Create a program which calculates the cost of buying different products at these prices.
• Loaf of bread - $1
• Noodles - $0.50
• Soup cans - $2

Step 2: Print out the cost of each item before printing out the total cost.

Step 3: Allow the program to calculate items sold not just by quantity, but also by weight. (Make sure when
printing the line for these items to include the weight, cost per unit, and the cost of the item.)
• Apples $2/pound

Step 4: Add in functionality so that if a customer buys a certain number of a product they get another one
for free.
• Soup cans - buy 4 get 1 free

Step 5: Add in functionality so that buying a certain number of a product adjusts the total price of that set.
• Noodles - 3 for $1
